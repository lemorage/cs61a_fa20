# CS61A Practices

This course is called _Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs_\
Time: Fall 2020\
Instructors: Hany Farid, John DeNero
- find here https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61a/fa20/

This course was an extremely wonderful set of training wheels, which taught me how to think about writing code at a deeper level.\
Thank you all for the lovely things UC Berkeley had shared online, and all the teachers and resources! Cheers! ðŸ§¡ðŸ’›ðŸ’™

> Like one of the teacher in this course said: 
>> â€œLearning happens when you donâ€™t solve the problem, when you are struggling through. When you have solved the problem, youâ€™ve learned, itâ€™s over. 
So the process of failure, the process of struggling, the process of taking hours to solve something is where the learning is happeningâ€¦"

And this repo just records how the process happens along the way for the sake of myself...
