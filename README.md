This course was an extremely wonderful set of training wheels, which taught me how to think about writing code at a deeper level.\
Thank you all for the lovely things UC Berkeley has shared online, and all the teachers and resources! Cheers!
> Like one of the teacher in this course said: 
>> “Learning happens when you don’t solve the problem, when you are struggling through. When you have solved the problem, you’ve learned, it’s over. 
So the process of failure, the process of struggling, the process of taking hours to solve something is where the learning is happening…"

And this repo just records how the process happens along the way for the sake of myself...
